# Raylib Synth
by m.z_.d
### What is this?
raylib-synth is meant to be a small-scale project to explore the basic functioning of Raylib as a GUI library (although that is not its primary intended use), as well as any other necessary libraries added on during development.  
This is also my [m.z_.d] first project in full C++, and might include shoddily formatted code.
### What will the finished product look like?
It will be a UNIX-compatible binary that includes a basic GUI interface, sound generation and keyboard input. The ultimate goal of this project is to create something similar (though much, much less advanced) to [Helm by Matthew Tytel](https://tytel.org/helm/).
### What license does this project fall under?
For now, none. As this is only meant to be a learning opportunity and not to produce a truly polished product, I see no point in restricting the distribution, copying or crediting of my code.
